# COMP 550 Final Project

## A Case Study on Character Level Convolutional Neural Networks

by Yuyan Chen, Yingxuan Wang, Zijun Zhao

General-purpose code partially borrowed from https://github.com/IngTian/COMP551_P4, written by Zijun Zhao.

Word-level CNN implementation based on the paper [Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882) by Yoon Kim (2014) borrowed from https://github.com/cezannec/CNN_Text_Classification

Experiment code is in `experiment1.py`, `experiment2.py`, and `main.py`
